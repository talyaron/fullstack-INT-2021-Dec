//object interfaces: Build an object that describes you(firstName, lastName, address). Within the object, build an array of friends. every friend should share the same categories as your own object. Build a function that accepts such an object and logs 'you have x number of friends who live in (array): [address1, address2, address3]. Challenge - build a function that describes that object. try to do that same thing with a Class selector. // 
// function friendsAddress (myFriends)(let i=0; i<friends.length; i++ ) {console.log(`I have `)}     
//     };
var myFriends = {
    "const": Ronny,
    IsPerson: IsPerson,
    "const": Jasmin,
    IsPerson: IsPerson,
    "const": Michal,
    IsPerson: IsPerson,
    "const": Danika = {
        firstName: 'Dana',
        lastName: 'Kemper',
        address: 'Sidon 4 Tel Aviv',
        friends: [Ronny, Jasmin, Michal]
    }
};
function nameFriends(Danika) { console.log("I have " + this.friends.length + " who live in " + this.friends.address); }
// }
// const introduceFriend = (frinendsOf c) => {
//     console.log (`you have ${firstName.friends} friends who lives in ${firstName.address}`);
// }
