// create an object the describes a basketball player
// - name
// - an array that conatain number of scores per each game
// - a method which return the average score per game (sum of all score / number of games)
// - * create data for "three pointers", free-throws, tow-pointers, and the method showd return the average scores 
// for each type (with object that contain the results)
