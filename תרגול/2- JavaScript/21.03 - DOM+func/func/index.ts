// 1. arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. 
// Check each number – if it is even, print it, otherwise print a message saying that the number is odd.

// 2. Write the function sumArrays which receives two arrays and returns their sum. 
// For example: [1, 4, 3] & [2, 5, 1, 9] => [3, 9, 4, 9]

// 4. Read numbers from the user, until the number 999 is entered. For each number:
// a. Print if it is divisible by 3.
// b. If it is bigger by more than 10 from the previous number, print a suitable message.

// 5. Implement the function getAsterisks(length) which returns a string of asterisks.
// The number of asterisks in the string is determined by length.
// For example: when the requested length is 4, it returns '****'

// 6. Read a number from the user (keep it as string such as “24367”) and then:
// i. Print each of its digits in a separate line.
// ii. Calculate the sum of its digits.
// iii. Calculate the multiplication (מכפלה ) of its digits.
// iv. Sum its first and last digits.
// v. Print it with its first and last digits swapped. (2731 => 1732)
// vi. Check whether it is symmetric. (like this number: 95459)
// vii. Print the number reversed.
